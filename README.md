# LoRa-Sim
MATLAB scripts for simulation of satellite link performance in the LoRa modulation, including the method I proposed in my barchelor's thesis titled "Closed-loop frequency error compensation for LoRa direct-to-satellite communications". https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/265812.

I have verified compatibility with MATLAB R2024b.
